## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to leverage visualizations made with Tableau to determine the feasibility of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, using a dataset from August, 2019 Citibike in New York. Various analyses were completed on the trip duration, frequency and ride time, and curated in a Tableau stoty. The full analysis can be found here: [Citibike August 2019 - Riders Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vanessa.mignelli/viz/CitibikeAugust2019Story/CitibikeRidersStory)

## Results

The first visual provides some insights on the customer breakdown. Through examining the pie chart below, we can derive that the total number of customers was 2,344,224. Of the total customers, 1,900,359 were subscribers to Citibike. The remaining 443,865 were casual or non-subscription customers.

With the second visual, we are able to derive the most and least frequent ride times. The most popular times to ride being 8AM, 5PM and 6PM, and the least popular times to ride being 2AM - 4AM inclusively.

The third visual examines total time bikes are checked out for all riders. From this, we are able to derive that close to 150 thousand bikes were checked out for under an hour.

The fourth visual aslo examines the total time bikes are checked out for all riders, but it is further categorized by gender. In this we can see that over 100 thousand were checked out by males, close to 40 thousands checked out by females and the remaining were unknown.

The fifth image is a heatmap depicting the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day. From this, it can be deducted that from Mon-Fri the most popular times for riding were 8AM and 5PM-6PM inclusively, with the greatest number of bike trips taking place at 6PM on Thursdays.

The sixth image aims to examine the same thing as the fifth, but is now segmented by gender. Similar patterns can be viewed between those who identified as males and females, with most rides taking place on Mon-Fri at 8AM and 5PM-6PM. However, the greater volume of these rides were taken by males than any other gender category. Thursday at 6PM contains the greatest amount of rides for both males and females. The unknown category follows no obvious pattern, but the most rides taken for this category happened on Saturdays.

The final image displays the number of bike trips by usertype and gender, for each day of the week as a heatmap. Within this heatmap it can be deduced that subscribers to the service have taken more trips than non-subscribers, with the greatest numbers of rides taken by males. For male and female subscribers, the most popular days to ride were Thursdays, Fridays and Tuesdays, respectively. Whereas non-subscribers most popular days to ride were Saturdays and Sundays, with the highest number of rides taken from the unknown category.

## Summary

Overall, from the analysis we are able to conclude that for the month of August, 2019 in New York, the Citibike service was most popular with males who took the greatest number of rides. Most users of the service were subscribers as oppose to those who used it on a more casual basis, and rides where most popular from Monday-Friday at 8AM and also 5PM-6PM. With regards to completing additional analyses using the dataset, it would be worth further examining demographics. For example, displaying the birth year in a pie chart to be able to understand in greater detail the age demographic who takes advantage of the service. To further this analysis, a stacked bar chart could examine the number male, female, and unknown rides per birth year. Another analysis could be displayed as a clustered horizontal bar chart, that would show the number of male, female and unknown riders per each hour of the day.
